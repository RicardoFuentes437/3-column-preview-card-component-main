## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I got to work a little bit more with media queries and understand how i can implement more than one of them depending on what i want the page to look like for different screen sizes.
I also got to implement the "fit-content" propery for the width of the main section.

### Continued development

So far the thing that has caused me a little bit more of trouble has been the responsiveness, so i want to continue practicing and learning about it.

### Useful resources

- [fit-content property](https://css-tricks.com/fit-content-and-fit-content/) - This helped me understand how the fit-content property works and how i can use it.
